## Design Patterns

**Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again 
in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem,
in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it 
the same way twice**

_A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction_ 


Repository contains the implementation for each design patterns. 
The project structure is: 

* [Creational](https://github.com/leomindez/design-patterns/tree/master/src/main/kotlin/com/leo/design/patterns/creational) 
* Behavioural 
* Structural 

## Creational
 
* [Singleton](https://github.com/leomindez/design-patterns/tree/master/src/main/kotlin/com/leo/design/patterns/creational/singleton)
* [Builder](https://github.com/leomindez/design-patterns/tree/master/src/main/kotlin/com/leo/design/patterns/creational/builder)
* [Prototype](https://github.com/leomindez/design-patterns/tree/master/src/main/kotlin/com/leo/design/patterns/creational/prototype)
* [Factory](https://github.com/leomindez/design-patterns/tree/master/src/main/kotlin/com/leo/design/patterns/creational/factory)
* [Abstract Factory](https://github.com/leomindez/design-patterns/tree/master/src/main/kotlin/com/leo/design/patterns/creational/abstractfactory)

All the implementations are based on: 
* [Design Patterns, Elements of reusable Object-Oriented software](https://www.amazon.com/Design-Patterns-Elements-Reusable-Object-Oriented/dp/0201633612)
* [Design Patterns in Java: Creational](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/design-patterns-java-creational/table-of-contents)
* [Design Patterns in Java: Behavioral by Bryan Hansen](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/design-patterns-java-behavioral/table-of-contents)


_**Kotlin Lang is used to implement all the patterns**_
